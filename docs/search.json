Welcome.\nI am very happy to welcome you.\nNewspapersâ€™ sentiments and real world events\nWhat really drives newspapers?\nDuring Covid anxiety was all over the place. People talked about the dangerous virus all the time and also newspapers reported a lot about Covid19.\nA lot of people thought that maybe the media exaggerated the threat coming from the virus to get more views and clicks.\nSo we wanted to check if the media really wanted to cause panic in the pandemic or if they tried to cover the objective hazard during the pandemic.\nSo we wanted to look at two very different countries. One country should have been hit hard by Covid and the other one should have been spared by Covid. So we chose the US and Australia. They match a good comparison because both countries are English speaking and have a similair culture. The US had a lot of deaths and stuggled a lot during the pandemic. Australia almost had non deaths during Corona they really tried to isolate the virus so it could not spread. We used for the US the CNN news and for Australia the ABC news. We looked at the sentiments of the titles and compared them with the deathrate during the pandemic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we can say is that Corona deaths during the pandemic is only one fuel to the sentiments. There have to be other factors that explain newspapers sentiments.\nSo now we want to make some correlations to check the real relationship of sentiments and real world happenings:\n\n\n\nSo we can see that the correlation is very small. We must find other variables that explain sentiments better!\nThank you very much for visiting my page :)\n\n\n\n",
